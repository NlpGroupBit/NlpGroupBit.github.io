abstract = "A quality headline with a high click-rate should not only summarize the content of an article, but also reflect a style that attracts users. Such demand has drawn rising attention to the task of stylistic headline generation (SHG). An intuitive method is to first generate plain headlines leveraged by document-headline parallel data then transfer them to a target style. However, this inevitably suffers from error propagation. Therefore, to unify the two sub-tasks and explicitly decompose style-relevant attributes and summarize content, we propose an end-to-end stage-wise SHG model containing the style generation component and the content insertion component, where the former generates stylistic-relevant intermediate outputs and the latter receives these outputs then inserts the summarized content. The intermediate outputs are observable, making the style generation easy to control. Our system is comprehensively evaluated by both quantitative and qualitative metrics, and it achieves state-of-the-art results in SHG over three different stylistic datasets."
